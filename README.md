# rusty_roll
An odd Rust program for creating video-embedded binaries. Great for awful memes.

Note:

This project can be used to store & save virtually any file into an executable.
However, there are typically far better ways to do so; this project is just a 
proof of concept.

PS. Meme your friends! :)
